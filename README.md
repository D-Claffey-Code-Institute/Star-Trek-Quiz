### User Stories

As a developer:
* I want the user to easily navigate the site.

### Color Scheme
The site consists of a background showing a picture of space. So I used text and bordering with the colour "Whitesmoke"

The font used is easy to read and clear against the dark background
For the font I used the Google font, Raleway
